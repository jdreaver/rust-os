# Rust OS

Inspired by [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) and <https://github.com/mrgian/felix>.

## Running in QEMU

Default debug mode:

```
$ make run
```

Release mode:

```
$ make run RUST_BUILD_MODE=release
```

UEFI disabled (use BIOS):

```
$ make run UEFI=off
```

## Debugging with GDB

In one terminal:

```
make run-debug
```

In another terminal:

```
make gdb
```

## Tests

Note that we don't use a Cargo workspace (I turned it off because LSP/Emacs
didn't seem to work well under it, and it isn't clear how cargo configs should
work across workspaces, e.g. <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7004>
and <https://rustwiki.org/en/cargo/reference/config.html>). That means `cargo
test` doesn't work at the top level. Also, we don't use Rust's testing library
for kernel code. Instead we do more integration-style tests. Pure code that
_can_ be tested is put in a separate crate and those use Rust's test system.

```
make test
```

## TODO

- Get APIC working <https://wiki.osdev.org/APIC>
  - Limine masks APIC by default!
- Multi-tasking
  - <https://wiki.osdev.org/Brendan%27s_Multi-tasking_Tutorial>
  - <https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/comments/jf1wgy/multitasking_tutorial/>
  - <https://wiki.osdev.org/Context_Switching>
  - <https://wiki.osdev.org/Kernel_Multitasking>
- Make `LockedNaiveFreeMemoryBlockAllocator` a global static instead of passing
  it around. The tricky part is all the things that want `&mut impl FrameAllocator`
  - Consider custom page table implementation to get around `&mut` requirements <https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/issues/416>
- PCI refactor
  - Consider PCI stuff as "visitors" to PCIe config memory. Same with VirtIO.
    Nothing should be cached in the struct, we don't need to allocate memory for
    anything, etc. It is just wrappers over pointers and read/write functions.
  - An actual concrete "device" type will use the visitors under the hood, but a separation might be meaningful.
  - Make PCI capabilities list a first class thing
    - Don't print them when debug printing the type 0 header!
    - Take inspiration from <https://docs.rs/pci-driver/latest/pci_driver/config/caps/index.html>
      - I like the idea of iterating over them and incrementally adding structure
- Figure out PCI interrupts (MSI-X?)
- VirtIO: Make RNG device a "thing" in its own file
- VirtIO: Ensure it is crystal clear that memory allocator needs to be contiguous
- `registers.rs` and macros
  - Consider moving `registers.rs` stuff into dedicated crate with unit tests
  - Also document `registers.rs` stuff
  - Consider using a proc macro to annotate fields on structs instead of
    code-generating the entire struct. This might get rid of the need for my PCI
    wrapper types because I can inline helper functions into the actual struct,
    and I can also include other information in the struct. Perhaps we can also
    handle the "embedding" case, where e.g. we want to easily be able to include
    the common PCI registers in a Type0 device struct, or allow VirtIO devices
    to include the common registers and the type 0 registers. Also, I think proc
    macros are more flexible.
    - Easier to set pub, private, pub(crate), etc
    - This would also allow us to group registers into dedicated structs. For
      example, have a struct for grouping (device_id, vendor_id), and maybe
      class, subclass, and prog_if. There really is no strict need to have all
      registers in the same struct generated through one macro, except it makes
      having a single `from_address` function and perhaps a `Debug`
      implementation nicer.
    - Find a way to use this macro for the virtq stuff, where the rings have dynamic size and then a struct member after that.
  - I really messed up my pointer math on some structs and now I'm scared. It
    would be _really_ nice to be able to rely on `#[repr(C)]` alignment rules,
    especially for VirtIO where they use C structs in the spec.
- Read [QEMU Internals](https://airbus-seclab.github.io/qemu_blog/)
- Filesystem support
  - Now that I have PCI working, attach a drive via QEMU and see what is looks like under PCI
    - I'm pretty sure there is just one SATA controller for multiple drives
  - Example <https://github.com/rafalh/rust-fatfs>
  - <https://wiki.osdev.org/FAT>
- Serial print deadlock during interrupt: if we hit an interrupt while we are in
  the middle of printing to the serial port, and the interrupt needs to print to
  the serial port, we can deadlock.
- Allocator designs <https://os.phil-opp.com/allocator-designs/>
- UEFI. I have it kind of set up, but I should poke at it more, and also investigate the Limine UEFI system table stuff
- Tests
  - <https://www.infinyon.com/blog/2021/04/rust-custom-test-harness/>
  - Useful resource, but I couldn't get this to work with the staticlib setup <https://os.phil-opp.com/testing/>
    - Try again with `main.rs`/ELF thanks to limine!
    - Might be useful <https://blog.frankel.ch/different-test-scopes-rust/>
    - Don't integrate with `cargo test`. Do `cargo build --tests` and have a `make test` target
  - Things to test:
    - Interrupts work (e.g. breakpoint).
      - Ensure breakpoint handler is called and that we resume
      - Ensure that fatal handlers like general protection fault are called then exit
    - Panic works (can exit with success after panic)
    - Double fault handlers work (e.g. stack overflow of kernel stack calls double fault handler)
    - Heap allocated memory, especially deallocation (create a ton of objects larger than the heap in a loop, which ensures that deallocation is happening or we would run out of memory)
- Unit tests for memory management, allocator, etc. Move to a new crate?
- Add CI
  - Check out <https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/blob/post-12/.github/workflows/code.yml>
  - Consider using nix to load dependencies


## Resources

### QEMU

In the QEMU monitor (Ctrl+Alt+2 in a QEMU graphical window), these are useful
for looking at devices:

```
$ info pci
$ info qtree
```

Finding QEMU device help

```
# List devices
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -device help

# Help for a specific device
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -device virtio-rng-pci,help

### Volatile memory access in Rust, and spurious reads

TL;DR: Use raw pointers instead of references to memory-mapped IO regions to
guarantee you won't have spurious reads. There is an excellent [blog
post](https://lokathor.github.io/volatile/) that explains this. There is also a
good [forum
thread](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-make-an-access-volatile-without-std-library/85533/)
explaining the dangers of this.
